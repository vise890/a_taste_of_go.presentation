A taste of Go

* Hello World

.play ./code/hello_world.go

- Go has a familiar semantics (don't be scared)
- It is a small and simple language (1-2 days to get productive in it)
- "A fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language"
- not the most revolutionary language, but really well executed, and fast.


* Why Go?

- compiler produces *statically* linked binaries (or `.exe`s..) that run everywhere
- compile times are *fast* (compiling on every save is feasible)
- has excellent tooling (test, fmt, vet, ...)
- comprehensive std. library (net/http, crypto, json, ...)
- lots of high-quality libraries (e.g. mongoDB driver is best in class)


* Some code: fibonacci

.play ./code/fibonacci.go


* Concurrency: Goroutines

- a goroutine is a go `func` running concurrently with others
- a "lightweight" thread
- very cheap
- multiplexed onto multiple OS threads as needed

.play ./code/goroutines.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/


* Concurrency: Channels

.image ./img/go_channels.jpg _ 700

In go, channels are a way to communicate between goroutines.

When sending, a goroutine blocks until the channel is free.
When receiving, a goroutine blocks until there's something to receive.

You can also buffer channels...


* Concurrency: a silly health checker

.play ./code/health_checker.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* DEMO: A micro api

Using:
- an http server: go's standard lib `net/http`
- a microframework (routing, response decoration, logging): `gin`
- a MongoDB driver: `mgo`
