# Why Go?
- I want to present go to you
- easy to learn
  - go has similar semantics to languages in the C family
  - so don't be scared of it
  - it is a small and simple language (spec is only a few pages)
  - in a few days, you should be able to write simple programs that are already useful

- compiler produces statically linked binaries
  - no runtime
  - run everywhere

- compile times are *fast*
  - feasible to compile on *every save*

- plenty of high-quality libs
  - std. library has many useful components (net/http, json, crypto)
  - tooling (test, fmt, vet)
  - lots of community contributed libs:
    - Steve Francia, the driver lead at MongoDB says that mgo is the best driver for mongo
