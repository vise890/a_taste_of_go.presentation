# Why Go?
- easy to learn?
  - go has similar semantics to the C family
  - so don't be scared of it
  - it is a small and simple language (2-3 days to get productive)

- compiler produces statically linked binaries (no runtime)

- compile times are *fast*
  - feasible to compile on *every save*

- plenty of high-quality libs
  - std. library (net/http, json, crypto)
  - tooling (test, fmt, vet)
